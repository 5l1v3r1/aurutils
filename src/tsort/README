This directory contains a port of OpenBSD's tsort implementation. [1]
Compared to the GNU implementation, it has the ability to break loops and
has better diagnostic ability - its use is however completely optional.

The only changes were the removal of the OpenBSD-specific pledge and
appending of bsd/ to certain headers to match libbsd. [2]
