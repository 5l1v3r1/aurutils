SYNOPSIS
  
  See the following BBS thread:

  https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=210621

INSTALLATION

  The master branch can be installed from the included PKGBUILD, or from
  the AUR under "aurutils-git". Dependencies are typically development
  versions, and the package may otherwise behave in unexpected ways.

  The release branch is recommended for general use, and is available in
  the AUR as "aurutils". Compability is NOT guaranteed between different
  versions, except for patch (0.0.x) releases.

USAGE

  For the release branch, see the README document in
  /usr/share/doc/aurutils/README, or online at:

  https://github.com/AladW/aurutils/blob/release/README

  For the master branch, see aurutils(7).

TROUBLESHOOTING

  Before filing a bug, check the following:

  1) Do you use the latest version of aurutils and its dependencies?

  2) Does the package conform to PKGBUILD(5) and the AUR package guidelines?

  3) Does the package provide the correct metadata on the AUR RPC interface?

  4) Does the package build with makepkg -s ?

  5) Is the problem reproducible, and not due to a misconfiguration of
     pacman, makepkg, sudoers, gpg or others?

  If yes to all, create a debug log:

    $ bash -x scriptname |& tee error.log

  and attach it to a new issue:
