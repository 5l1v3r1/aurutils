SYNOPSIS
  
  See the following BBS thread:

  https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=210621

INSTALLATION

  The master branch can be installed from the included PKGBUILD, or from
  the AUR under "aurutils-git". Dependencies are typically development
  versions, and the package may otherwise behave in unexpected ways.

  The latest release version is recommended for general use, and is
  available in the AUR under "aurutils". Compability is NOT guaranteed
  between different versions, except for patch (0.0.x) releases.

USAGE

  See aurutils(7) for examples and general information.

TROUBLESHOOTING

  Before filing a bug, check the following:

  1) Do you use the latest version of aurutils and its dependencies?

  2) Does the package conform to PKGBUILD(5) and the AUR package guidelines?

  3) Does the package provide the correct metadata on the AUR RPC interface?

  4) Does the package build with makepkg -s ?

  5) Is the problem reproducible, and not due to a misconfiguration of
     pacman, makepkg, sudoers, gpg or others?

  If yes to all, create a debug log:

    $ bash -x scriptname |& tee error.log

  and attach it to a new issue:
