## SYNOPSIS
  
__aurutils__ is a collection of scripts to automate usage of the [Arch
User Repository](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_User_Repository), 
with different tasks such as package searching, update checks, or computing 
dependencies kept separate.

The chosen approach for managing packages is local pacman
repositories, rather than foreign (installed by `pacman -U`)
packages.
  
## INSTALLATION

Install one of the following packages:

* [`aurutils`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/aurutils) for the
release version _(recommended)_.
* [`aurutils-git`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/aurutils-git)
for the master branch.

Upgrade notices are posted to the 
[Arch forums](https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=210621).
