.SH NOTES

.SS HISTORY REWRITES
.B aur-fetch
will refuse to fetch rewritten history by default. This happens rarely,
as only Trusted Users have permissions to force-push to the AUR.

In those situations, something serious may have happened that may
require the user to do manual intervention on the machine.
To raise awareness to these events,
.B aur-fetch
will refuse to fetch unless
.B \-\-force
is passed.
