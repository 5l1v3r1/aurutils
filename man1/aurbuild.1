.SH NAME
aurbuild \- build packages to a local repository

.SH SYNOPSIS
.SY aurbuild
.OP \-cs
.OP \-a queue
.OP \-d database
.OP \-p pool
.OP \-r root
.OP \--
.OP "makepkg args"
.YS

.SH DESCRIPTION
Build packages, adding the results to a local repository (usually
configured with a \fIfile:// \fRprefix \fRin \fIpacman.conf\fR).

It is assumed that build directories are located in the current
directory, and described in a text file which is taken as argument.

.SH OPTIONS
All arguments after -- are passed to \fImakepkg\fR, or
\fImakechrootpkg \fRwhen \fI-c \fRis specified.

.B \-a
.RS
A text file with directories containing a PKGBUILD.
.RE

.B \-c
.RS
Build packages with \fImakechrootpkg\fR.
.RE

.B \-C
.RS
Set the parent directory of the nspawn container. Defaults to
\fI/var/lib/aurbuild\fR. Containers are kept in subdirectories named
after the system architecture, for example
\fI/var/lib/aurbuild/x86_64\fR.
.RE

.B \-d
.RS
The name of the database.
.RE

.B \-r
.RS
The root for the repository where the database files will live. This
defaults to the \fIServer\fI value of the configured database.
.RE

.B \-p
.RS
The pool for the built packages. The \fBpool \fRis the location where
packages are placed after building (using \fIPKGDEST\fR). This
defaults to the value of the repository root.
.RE

.B \-s
.RS
Sign built packages and the database with gpg.
.RE

.SH NOTES
When building locally (outside a container), \fIpacman -Syu \fR is run
while restricted to a local repository. This is comparable to
\fImakepkg -i\fR, but without subsequent package installation (if a
package was installed before, it is updated to the latest available
version). An interesting side-effect is that pacman considers packages
inside the official repositories "local", and warns if they are newer
than any custom counterpart. Packages which define a \fIreplaces\fR
field are ignored if the target package is installed on the local
system.

Databases are built with \fILANG=C\fR to avoid libalpm from skipping
entries if the locale is not set (FS#49342). Packages are signed
manually with \fIgpg --verbose --detach-sign --no-armor\fR (FS#49946).

.SS Building with \fBmakechrootpkg\fR
The template (or \fIroot\fR) container is upgraded with \fIpacman
-Syu\fR prior to building. This is done as the \fI$USER\fR container
is copied from the \fIroot\fR container before each build
(\fImakechrootpkg -c\fR).

Changes to the pacman database are \fBnot\fR propagated from the
container to the local system. Packages must be installed and updated
separately, typically through \fIpacman -Syu <package_name>\fR.

Package conflicts inside the container must be solved manually, as
\fBmakechrootpkg\fR uses \fImakepkg --confirm -s\fR internally. For
example, to replace \fBgcc\fR with \fBgcc-multilib\fR, run \fIarch-nspawn
/var/lib/aurbuild/root pacman -S gcc-multilib\fR as root.

Signature verification requires that \fBgpg2\fR(1) configuration is
stored in \fI~/.gnupg\fR. See Github issue #151 for details.

.SS Avoiding password prompts
makepkg must be run as a regular user as of version 4.2, with
privileged operations done via \fIsudo\fR. As such, \fIaurbuild\fR can
not be run directly as root. To avoid password prompts,
\fBsudoers\fR(5) can be used instead.

For example:
.EX

%build localhost = (root) NOPASSWD: SETENV: /usr/bin/makechrootpkg
%build localhost = (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/arch-nspawn

Note that variables specified on the sudo command line (such as
\fIPKGDEST\fR by \fBaurbuild\fR) depend on sudo policy; see
\fBsudo\fR(8) and \fBsudoers\fR(5).
