by name and description without regular expression support.

.SH NOTES
As the AUR RPC is limited to GET requests, queries are split by 150
arguments to avoid HTTP 414 errors (FS#49089). The results are merged
to a single JSON structure.

PCRE searches are done by matching regular expressions against
\fIpackages.gz\fR or \fIpkgbase.gz\fR, and querying the result with
the RPC. This is done as the AUR itself has no regex support
(FS#49099).
