.SH NOTES
As the AUR RPC is limited to GET requests, queries are split by 150
arguments to avoid HTTP 414 errors (FS#49089). The results are merged
to a single JSON structure.

PCRE searches are done by matching a pattern against
\fIpackages.gz\fR, and querying the result with the RPC. This is done
as the AUR itself has no regex support (FS#49099).
