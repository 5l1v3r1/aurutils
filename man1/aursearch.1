.TH AURSEARCH 1 2016-05-18 AURUTILS
.SH NAME
aursearch \- search AUR package names by pcre pattern

.SH SYNOPSIS
.SY aursearch
.OP \-brv
.OP -F string
.I pattern
.YS

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBaursearch\fR searches the AUR by a PCRE pattern. If the query
contains multiple patterns, the union of all pattern results is
returned.

.SH OPTIONS
.B \-F
.RS
Search for a fixed string instead of a PCRE pattern.
.RE

.B \-b
.RS
Match pkgbase instead of pkgname.
.RE

.B \-r
.RS
Output JSON from AUR RPC.
.RE

.B \-v
.RS

.RE

.SH NOTES
As the AUR RPC is limited to GET requests, queries are split by 150
arguments to avoid HTTP 414 errors (FS#49089). The results are merged
to a single JSON structure.

PCRE searches are done by matching regular expressions against
\fIpackages.gz\fR or \fIpkgbase.gz\fR, and querying the result with
the RPC. This is done as the AUR itself has no regex support
(FS#49099).
