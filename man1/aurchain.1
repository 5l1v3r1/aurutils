.SH NAME
aurchain \- solve and order dependencies using the aur rpc
.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.SY aurchain
.OP pkgname
.OP pkgname...
.YS
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
aurchain takes package names and then solves and orders the
dependencies for those packages using the AUR RPC interface.
.
.SH NOTES
The depends_\fIarch \fRarray (as introduced with pacman 4.2) is merged
with regular depends in the RPC. \fBaurchain \fRworkarounds this by
stripping the \fIlib32- \fRsuffix from packages and \fIgcc-multilib
\fRwhen the i686 architecture is detected.
